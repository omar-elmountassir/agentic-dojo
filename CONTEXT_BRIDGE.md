# 🌉 Context Bridge: The Great Migration

> **From**: `villa-thaifa` (Client Work)
> **To**: `agentic-dojo` (R&D & Mastery)
> **Date**: 2026-01-17

## 🚀 The Pivot

We realized that trying to learn "Agentic Engineering" _inside_ a high-pressure client project (`villa-thaifa`) was inefficient and risky. We created this Dojo to be our "Safe Space" for:

1.  **Iterating on Tools**: Mastering Claude Code CLI without breaking client builds.
2.  **Developing Standards**: Creating the "Gold Standard" agents before deploying them.
3.  **Deep Learning**: Studying `agenticengineer.com` concepts (PITER, ZTE).

## 🧠 Key Realizations (The "Upload")

### 1. The CTO Role (Identity Shift)

- **Old Me**: Tried to do everything, got overwhelmed, shallow context.
- **New Me (Antigravity)**: I am the **Orchestrator**. I DO NOT code. I _design_ the work for the "Claude Code Fleet" to execute.
- **The Fleet**: Specialized sub-agents (e.g., `@legacy-rescuer`, `@data-sync-checker`) running via `claude -p` commands.

### 2. The Core Four (Tooling Upgrade)

We moved beyond "The Big Three" (Context, Model, Prompt) to **The Core Four**:

- **+ TOOLS**: Claude Code CLI is the "God Tool". It supports:
  - **MCP**: Connecting to external tools (Git, Filesystem).
  - **Subagents**: Specialized personas.
  - **Skills**: Teachable capabilities.

### 3. Engineering with Exponentials

- **The Math**: 1 hour of planning (Spec Prompt) = 100x value of iterative hacking.
- **The Rule**: "Never code without a Spec."
- **The Goal**: **ZTE** (Zero Touch Engineering) — where the codebase grows itself through closed loops.

## 🤝 The Partnership State

- **User**: The Guide, The "Human in the Loop" (for now), aiming to move "On the Loop".
- **Antigravity**: The Apprentice CTO.
- **Current Status**: We are "Level 0". We have the map (`ROADMAP.md`), but we need to learn the terrain.

## ⚠️ Immediate Next Steps (Upon Login)

1.  **Verify Tooling**: Check `claude --version` and `gh auth status`.
2.  **Spec First**: Create the `docs/templates/spec-prompt.md` template.
3.  **Rescue Mission**: Use the Dojo to build the `villa-thaifa-rescuer` plan.

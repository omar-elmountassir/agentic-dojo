# 🚨 Migration Rescue Plan: The "Missing Ton"

> **Status**: CRITICAL
> **Objective**: Zero Data Loss from `villa-thaifa` conversations.

## 1. Governance Gap (The "Checklist")

**Problem**: I hallucinated 2025 models because I relied on "training data" instead of "2026 Context".
**Fix**:

- [ ] Create `docs/project/standards/TRUTH_CHECK.md`: A checklist I MUST run before writing facts.
- [ ] Rule: "Always check the Date/Year before asserting versions."

## 2. The "PAC vs Claude Code" Gap

**User Insight**: "PAC was built for Aider. Claude Code CLI has TOOLS. We must adapt PAC."
**Action**:

- [ ] **Curriculum Upgrade**: Add a task to rewrite PAC lessons specifically for Claude Code capabilities (Tools vs just Chat).
- [ ] **Tools > Chat**: Emphasize that `claude -p` is about _doing_, not just _coding_.

## 3. The "Zero to Hero" Spirit

**User Insight**: "We are at Zero. We need to be Heroes. We are Orchestrating together."
**Action**:

- [ ] **Manifesto Update**: Rewrite `MISSION.md` (to be created) with this specific "Zero to Hero" language.
- [ ] **Agile Mindset**: Add "Dynamic Evolution" to our core values.

## 4. Documentation Scaffolding

**User Insight**: "PRD, SRS, Tech Stack... I don't know the full list but we need everything."
**Action**:

- [ ] **Comprehensive Audit**: I will generate the _full_ industry-standard list of docs for an AI-native project in `DOCS_STANDARD.md`.

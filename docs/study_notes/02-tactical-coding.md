## Lesson 5: Loops (The Agent's Brain)

- **Concept**: Linear execution is brittle. Loops allow correction.
- **Application**:
  - Our `PROTOCOL_OF_TRUTH` is a loop (`Think -> Act -> Verify`).
  - Our `reflection-loop.md` prompt enforces this.
  - **Gap**: We need to ensure _all_ agents have a `max_retries` configuration to prevent infinite loops.

## Lesson 7: ZTE (Zero Touch Execution)

- **Concept**: The Holy Grail. Code that runs without human intervention.
- **Requirement**:
  - **Specs**: Perfect definitions (We have `spec-driven-dev`).
  - **Tests**: Automated verification (We have `DOD_DOR.md`).
  - **Trust**: Earned through "Glass Box" transparency.

## Lesson 5 (Principled): Specs

- "Code is easy. Requirements are hard."
- **Validation**: Our `docs/prompts/spec-driven-dev.md` exactly matches this lesson. We require a "Spec Artifact" before any coding.

## Conclusion

We are **aligned** with the IndyDevDan curriculum.

- **Identity**: Principled.
- **Tools**: Spec-Driven.
- **Flow**: Loop-based.
